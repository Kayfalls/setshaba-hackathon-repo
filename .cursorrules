# CommunityPulse - AI Community Intelligence Platform
# 48-hour hackathon project for enhanced customer experience

## Project Context
Building an AI-powered platform that analyzes community communication, prevents misinformation, and provides actionable insights to property managers and community leaders.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python + FastAPI + SQLite
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS + Chart.js
- AI/ML: NLTK, VADER sentiment analysis, scikit-learn
- Deployment: Docker + cloud hosting

## Development Priorities
1. SPEED over perfection (48-hour constraint)
2. Working demo over comprehensive features
3. Clean, readable code with good error handling
4. Mobile-responsive design
5. Clear API documentation

## Key Features to Implement
- Community post ingestion and analysis
- Real-time sentiment analysis
- Misinformation detection alerts
- Community health scoring
- Property manager dashboard
- Issue priority ranking

## Coding Guidelines
- Use FastAPI for all backend endpoints
- Include proper validation and error handling
- Use Tailwind utility classes only (no custom CSS)
- Generate realistic sample data for demos
- Focus on 3 core features maximum
- Include security best practices (JWT, input validation)

## Avoid
- Over-engineering solutions
- Complex authentication systems
- Unnecessary dependencies
- Features beyond core MVP scope

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Backend API with FastAPI and AI analysis
- ✅ Frontend React app with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Real-time sentiment analysis
- ✅ Misinformation detection
- ✅ Community health scoring
- ✅ Interactive dashboard with charts
- ✅ Alert system for high-priority issues
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Sample data generation
- ✅ API documentation

## Development Focus Areas
1. **AI/ML Integration**: VADER sentiment analysis, misinformation detection
2. **Real-time Processing**: Instant analysis of community posts
3. **Data Visualization**: Charts and analytics for insights
4. **User Experience**: Intuitive, mobile-friendly interface
5. **Scalability**: Microservices architecture ready for production

## Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration
- Error handling without exposing internals
- Rate limiting (ready for implementation)
- JWT authentication (ready for implementation)

## Performance Optimization
- Efficient database queries
- Optimized React components
- Lazy loading where appropriate
- Minimal bundle sizes
- Fast API responses

## Testing Strategy
- Manual testing with realistic sample data
- API endpoint validation
- UI component testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness testing
